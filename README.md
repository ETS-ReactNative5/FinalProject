# Dog Walk Nation

Welcome to the code repository for my Final Year Project, a dog walking application called Dog Walk Nation.

In this repository you will find the code for my mobile application ([WebApp](https://github.com/Frankles143/FinalProject/tree/master/WebApp)), written in React Native and the code for my API ([DogWalkNationAPI folder](https://github.com/Frankles143/FinalProject/tree/master/DogWalkNationAPI)), written in C#. 

For more information and further instructions on how to use the mobile application, please navigate to the [WebApp folder](https://github.com/Frankles143/FinalProject/tree/master/WebApp).
